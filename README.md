# Object-oriented Programming
This is the branch for the `Object-oriented Programming` course

If using ***VSCode***, use the build task to compile the current active file with `gcc`, 
using `Ctr-Shift-B`. This generates the output binary in the `./bin/` dir

Other fully-fledged IDEs (CLion, Visual Studio, etc) should be able to run files out-of-the-box

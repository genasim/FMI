# Data Structures and Algorithms
This is the branch for the `Data Structures and Algorithms` course  
  
When using ***VSCode***:
- If you want to build any of the files in the `cpp-files` dir, open `cpp-files` as your workspace folder and use the build task to compile the current active file with `gcc`, using `Ctr-Shift-B`. This generates the output binary in the `./bin/` dir
- If you want to build any of the projects in the `projects` dir, use the `Makefile` there (you can also open each of the projects as a workspace folder and use VSCode's commands)

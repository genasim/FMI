# Function Programming
This is the branch for the `Function Programming` course.

To run `.hs` files you need to have `ghcup` setup on your system -> refer
to the official Haskell documentation for that.

Point is, you need to have the `runhaskell` command availabe in your `HOME_DIR`.
- Run `runhaskell <path to .hs file>` to run the file in the console
- Use the configured VSCode task to run `runhaskell` for the currently open `.hs` file -> `CTR` + `SHIFT` + `B`
- Or some Haskell runner VSCode extension
- Or some Haskell IDE ... idk ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

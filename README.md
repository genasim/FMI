# Function Programming
This is the branch for the `Function Programming` course.

To run `.hs` files you need to have `ghcup` setup on your system -> refer
to the official Haskell documentation for that.

After that you could run `runhaskell <.hs file>` to run the file in the console
Or some Haskell IDE ... idk ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
